25th Sept.:
    upon piping |:
        -the prompt disappear after execution (solved, I forgot to put i = 0; before entering the wait(NULL) loop, in exec multiple pipes file)
        -if given 2nd wrong command it gives an infinite while loop of prompt that take itself as command then print (pending)


27th sept:
    -when export through an error the prompt don't execute any commands
    -Do the exit status for wrong export

3rd Oct:
	-CTR C doesn't interrupt infinite loop operation
	-When one command hang, I had the prompt but it doesn't implement any commands
4th Oct:
	should I save the double and single quotes with the command or no?
	I believe no
	fix it in the morning inshalla
	then do the redirections
	fill the cmds list
	then try the redirections 
	then the heredoc
	then the extreme cases
	then expansion of the $ and ? 
	inshalla
